<h1 align="center">Simple Shop MERN</h1>

<p>Simple shop application to add products developed to complete a challenge in a course that I follow.</p>
<p>To run this product first go to frontend folder and execute<br>
  <code>npm install</code><span> to install dependencies. And then,</span><br>
  <code>npm start</code> <br>
  And then open another terminal and execute<br>
  <code>npm install</code><span> to install dependencies. And then,</span><br>
  <code>npm start</code> <span>again.</span>
</p>

<p>In this folder, no database is used. SO, you don't have to worry about 
  database configuration
</p>
